Odin Project Google Homepage

    Two ways to move a div around on the page
    Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
    Identify the background color of an existing webpage
    Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
    Center an element horizontally
    Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
    Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
    Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

Are the main targets before starting the project.

Turns out that not much soaked in from freecodecamp. While this is frustrating, I won't let this discourage me from continuing with the project. My plan is to do what I can, go through freecodecamp again, then fix what I haven't learned. I will also go through the optional projects until I understand what I'm doing fully.

Now I've spent some time Googling issues, reviewing what I have learned, and testing out code using live server and developer tools. Only cheated a little to see how google made their bottom text gray and their top text black when they used anchor for all of the tags, turns out they just made a class and applied it to seven separate anchors.

TODO: Center search content and bottom nav bar

Retiring project for now, spending too much time bugfixing problems which aren't currently relevant. Happy with how far I came though.
